Hello and welcome to the source code for the book
Practical Flutter by Frank W. Zammetti!

Each chapter that has code associated with it (not all do) has it's own
directory.  Each source file in a given directory, for the most part,
is a full program that you can either run in DartPad (for the Dart-only
chapters) or that you can drop in main.dart of a newly-created Flutter app
and run (there may be a few exceptions to this, but it should mostly be true).

Chapters 5 and 6 combined cover the FlutterBook app.
Chapters 7 and 8 combined cover the FlutterChat app.
Chapter 9 is the FlutterHero game app.

Each of the apps is an Android Studio project that you SHOULD be able to just
load up and play with right away.

All of this code was developed and confirmed working under the following
versions:

Flutter: 1.5.4-hotfix.2 (stable channnel)
Framework: revision 7a4c33425d
Engine: revision 52c7a1e849
Tools: Dart 2.3.0 (build 2.3.0-dev.0.5 a1668566e5)
Android Studio: 3.4
Android toolchain: Android SDK version 28.0.3

While it all SHOULD work on newer versions, or even some older one, the author
does not warrant this code on any versions other than those listed.

Thank you very much for purchasing and reading my book!  Take care!
